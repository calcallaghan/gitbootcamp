This repository is being set up so that I can test my work with git, mostly on the command line, and become more familiar with the tools.

My main aim is to build fluency with git and other DevOps tools, both for my own enjoyment, and for the purpose of being a better Product Manager for DevTools.

I made this repo remotely all on the Mac Terminal command line using zsh, with NeoVim for text editing.
